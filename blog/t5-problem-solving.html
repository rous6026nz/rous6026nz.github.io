                <header class="blog-post-header"><h1>What was the problem?</h1></header>
                <div class="blog-text">
                    <p>When I was first introduced to HTML and CSS, I had a an issue with my web pages not linking up and the image links always breaking. I was using Adobe Dreamweaver, and it had a feature where you could switch between code and visual views. I would use the visual view to place images and add links to other files in my website, so I didn't fully understand the concept of linking images and other pages properly.</p>

                    <p>As a result I would move files around in the directory not known I was breaking the links in my website, and every time I would open up Dreamweaver to work on my assignment, all of the links were broken and I was wondering why.</p>

                <div class="blog-text">
                    <p>Techniques I used to try and solve this problem included Googling on the internet, asking peers and trying something.</p>

                    <p>Being new to Web Development I didn't understand the web terminology and found it hard to ask the right questions and describe the issues I was facing, so my searches weren't returning the right results.</p>

                    <p>When asking my peers, it was abit easier to describe the issues as I was able to show people the problems on my computer. However, I found a large majority were also struggling with a similar issue and were also very new to Web Development.</p>

                    <p>In the end, playing around with the code and trying different things actual help my solve the probelms I was having with broken links and as a result helped me understand why it was happening and how to solve it in the future.</p>

                    <p>Initial frustrated, but by the end relieved and quiet proud that I was able to solve the issue myself. I also felt a sense of enlightenment because I felt I was starting to understand the code abit better.</p>

                <div class="blog-text">
                    <p>Learning outcomes from this experience included, taking the time to examine the code and trying to understand what each part is trying to do and determining the folder structure of your website before jumping into the code, so there is less chance of restructing late in the project leading to broken links etc.</p>

                    <p>A recent project I worked on was a Wordpress website with a custom built theme developed by an overseas company which had custom intergrations with a recruitment service API.</p>
                    <p>My initial involvement with this project was to implement frontend changes to improve user experience, but later was asked to investigate an issue with a feature that alerts users when a new job within a department they are interested in is posted.</p>

                <div class="blog-text">
                    <p>The first techique I used was inspect the error log in the developer tools. I identified an error message which confirmed the problem was occuring, I was able to trace the error back to the file generating the error. I also used Google to find out more information about the error, the various conditions that could cause this error and suggestions to fix the error.</p>

                    <p>I felt good throughout the problem solving process, with a number of years experienceas a web developer made it easier tackling this problem. I have become familiar with the various tools available to developers and how to use them, so investigating the issue wasn't as stressful as it would have been if I was new to web development.</p>

                    <p>I learn't the importance of the call stack feature of the developer tools. Being able to run your javascript code line by line, adding breaks, seeing what values are being returned, seeing which methods and/or variables are being hoisted and observing the order methods are being executed.</p>

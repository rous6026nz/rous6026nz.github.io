          <div class="blog-text">
              <p>The similarities between mindfulness and self-awareness is that they are both trainable in similar ways, exercise a grounded and steady mind despite emotional movement.</p>
              <p>Both also allow the practitioner to view themselves with third-person objectivity, and to be able to recognise emotions as something that occurs in the body and mind and not apart of their character.</p>

              <h5>What was your experience of it?</h5>
              <p>I tried Body Scanning and found it relaxing and soothing. Paying attention to each section of the body and taking the time to experience what is happening in that area of the body, acknowledging any feelings and letting them go if they want to. It was easy and it actually felt like after this experience areas with tension and stress were some how relieved a little?</p>
              <h5>How did you feel?</h5>
              <p>After performing the body scan practice, I felt relaxed with less tension in my body and muscles, I felt a sense of clarity and calmness in my mind and thoughts and refreshed as if I had almost done a full mind and body cleanse.</p>

              <p>When I first watch the video <a href="https://siyli.org/resources/meng-presents-at-dreamforce" target="__new">"Meng Presents at Dreamforce"</a>, 16:28 minutes into the video he explained a concept called The Big Sky Mind which suggests that we are the sky, and thoughts and emotions are simply clouds in mind and body that come and go.</p>

			<p>I found it interesting that mindfulness is able to change the way our minds process emotions from being existential - our emotions become our existence, to being experiential - emotions become something we experience in the body, and suggests the possibility of being able to master our emotions.</p>
			
			<p>The same way we feel pain after in our bodies after exercising, they are both physical experiences which we have influence over. Meaning we can soothe them or ignore them and care on.</p>

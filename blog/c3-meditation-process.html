                <div class="blog-text">
                    <p>Looking back, I feel the design process took a product focused approach. This was due in part to the nature of the task, implementing features I added to my wishlist from the CSS Zen Garden website audit.</p>
                    <p>Using inspiration taken from the CSS Zen Garden websites, had a strong influence on the final product. To implement some of the features, I designed my wireframes to accommedate those features for both desktop and mobile.</p>

                <div class="blog-text">
                    <p>Before reading chapter 2, my initial thoughts about meditation was that meditation was a practice of training your mind, being able to calm your mind and eventually reaching inner peace.</p>
                    <p>After reading chapter 2, I found it interesting about the research conducted by reseachers and scientists regarding meditation, is the scientific evidence found between those who practice meditation and those who don't.</p>
                    <p>The findings from those studies showed remakable physical changes for those that practiced meditation, from a measurably lower anxiety levels to a significant increase in parts of the brain associated with positive emotions, an increase in developing immunity to greatly accelerating the healing of a skin condition known as psoriasis.</p>
                    <p>And for those who have practiced for long periods of time, the results were even greater.</p>

                <header class="blog-post-header"><h1>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h1></header>
                <div class="blog-text">
                    <p>Apart from the previous comments, I learn't that meditation can be as simple as focusing on your breathing, or just being. You can meditate with your eyes open or closed, losing focus while meditating doesn't mean you have broken your meditation and you can meditate any way you feel comfortable (standing, sitting, crossing your legs or laying down).</p>
                    <p>I also found it interesting how you could be relaxed and alert at the same time and that mindfulness exercises can take as little as 2 mnutes a day.</p>

                <header class="blog-post-header"><h1>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h1></header>
                <div class="blog-text">
                    <p>A technique I found interesting was by Sogyal Rinpoche a Tibetan Buddhist teacher around finding your own posture, was to think of your favourite mountain, and pretend to be that moutain when you sit.</p>
                    <p>Being new to meditaion, I felt getting my posture right was a good way of starting. Another technique that stood out for me, was the 2 concepts of practicing mindfulness meditation - easy and easier. Easy being focusing on your breathing, from your abdomane, chest, your nostrals, the air being inhaled or the air being exhaled, and easier being just being. </p>

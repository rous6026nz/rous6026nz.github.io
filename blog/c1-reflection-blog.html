            <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            To me, it sounds like the DBC/EDA experience is one which is aimed at providing you with not only the soft skill's to program, 
            but also the skill's and work ethic which will prepare you to enter the workforce with the right mindset and capabilities potential 
            employers are looking for.

            <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            I feel DBC/EDA are more like a group of people who are passionate about what they do, and love sharing  
            their knowledge, experiences and nurturing growth in their students.

            I anticipate getting stuck in and soaking up as much as I can, I can't wait to get started on my new journey at EDA 
            and meeting, sharing knowledge and learning with my peers.

            <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            No. Prior to signing up with EDA, I researched, met tutors, staff and current students and graduates of the EDA Auckland campus as well as 
            visited the campus on a number of occasions through various Meet up groups I attend.
        </p>    
        <p>
            From meeting people who attended EDA, I could tell by their attitudes, the environment in which EDA provides for learning a long with 
            their involvment in the developer community in Auckland, it was, and still is a place I wanted to apart of.

        <p>
            Yes, I can't wait to start my journey with EDA, it's been a long time coming.
        </p>
        <p>
            No, I'm not nervous.

          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>
                I have not tried any of the insights and techniques for growing trust and sincerity, however, I can recall a time when I felt the affects of what I now understand to be the <em>5 dysfunctions of a team</em>, where I felt the lack of trust in my manager, resulting in me holding back from contributing in group debates, confrontations and feedback processes and eventually the lack of commitment towards my team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I felt I was not being heard, not included and felt resentment toward my manager for that, and eventually was transfered to another team. Looking back now after reading chapter 8, I now see how this happened and understand how I could have prevented this from happening in the future.

          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>
                I haven't had the chance to try empathic listening, but find it interesting listening for the speakers feelings as they are speaking, then reporting back what emotions I thought they felt. In a real world situation I feel it would be quiet hard and would take some practice to consentrate on the content of the conversation as well as observing the emotionally changes in the speaker.

            <p>
                I found it very relaxing, especially when thinking about a person I feel neutral about or dislike. Thinking about that person and saying to meself <em>"I wish for him to be well, happy and free from suffering"</em> made me feel less resentment towards that person, and the very next time I saw that person, I felt less hostility towards them and thought positive thoughts about that person - thinkng, they are human just like me, they want to be happy just like me and they too want to be successful just like me.

            <h5>Situation From My Perspective:</h5>
            <p>
                I was part of a sprint project that was not managed well and had endured significant scope creep throughout the duration of the sprint. I had (to my knowledge) completed my tasks in the project to a reasonably high standard, both I and the project manager felt the work had been completed to the fit the sprint goals, and I had moved on to my next project. A week into my new sprint, I was confronted by the project manager of my previous sprint regarding a task that needed to be done urgently after the sprint had ended.
            </p>
            <h5>Situation From Their Perspective:</h5>
            <p>
                Zaine has delivered his sprint tasks on time and to a high standard, however, we have an urgent task that needs to be completed and require Zaine to pick this up as soon as possible. Although this sprint has finished and we don't have his resources, the business requires this task to be completed with priority so we can launch this new website.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have notified Zaine of this last task and have provided him with the relevent information to complete the work, as well as timelines and the priority level of the work. I have not seen any progress so far and wonder if he realises the potential impact this has on the project and the amount of stress I am under to deliver this last feature.

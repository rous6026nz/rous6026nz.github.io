          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>
              Life through the lens of pleasure, passion and purpose would look like the ideal working environment where everyone knows their deepest values and motivations. Employees enjoy their jobs, enjoy going to work, are becoming better at what they do and are much more engaged within their organisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Employees are comfortable in their roles, are high performing because they genuinely enjoy the work they are doing and are getting recognition for the work the are doing from their peers, managers and/or CEO's.

          <div class="blog-text">
            <h5>What are your core values?</h5>
            <p>
              When I think about whats most important to me, it is helping others, within my community, my culture, my family, friends and anyone around me. Whether it's technically or personally, I want to inspire and help others achieve to their full potential in life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another core value that is imortant to me is "treat people how I would like to be treated". This value helps me to be a better person to everybody in my life and around me as it ensures I treat everybody equally regardless of my past encounters or experiences.
            </p>
            <h5>What do you stand for?</h5>
            <p>
              I stand for self-awareness and being yourself. Being comfortable within your own skin, your abilities and doing what you believe in and what aligns with your values is what I feel strongly about. It is something I encourge anyone and everyone around me to be and it is something I find myself reflecting on regularly to provide guidance when needed.

          <header class="blog-post-header"><h1>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h1></header>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>
              It was interesting bringing back and analysing emotions and feels from past experiences of success and failure, in doing this I felt the strongest feelings about people around me, and their reactions, comments and support.
            </p>
            <p>
              One that really stood out to me while reflecting on failure, was the support I recieved from my manager. Up until that time I never felt I could turn to him for support as we had vastly differing fields of expertise. But, he was able to provide me support in other ways which were very helpful and comforting at that time and moment.
